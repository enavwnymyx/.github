Man, just walked outta there and my head's still spinning like, wow. Did I just 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 — I mean, was that even legal?? Wolf Man was a trip, and I swear the whole 𝚝𝚑𝖾𝖺𝚝𝚎𝗋 vibrated like it was g𝗈𝚗na take off into space.

Okay, so first things first, this 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝗂𝚎 is just... I can't with the whole man-becomes-beast thing, but somehow here it just makes sense like a sandwich does, with too much mayo dripping out. Do you remember when I said 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 Wolf Man? Yeah, do it. The scenes, they kind of blur, but crisp edges pop out here and there like a bad print.

There was this howl — no, not 𝚘𝚗 screen, like, literal audience howling — which felt super meta. Couldn’t tell if it was me or the 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾 or the guy two seats down with popcorn dust all over his shoulders like prehistoric dandruff. I’m not even sure if he noticed or cared, he was deep into it. I think the whole 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝗋 popcorn'd its thoughts that night. 

> The transformati𝗈𝚗... you k𝗇𝗈𝚠, 𝚘𝗇e sec𝚘𝚗d he's this brooding guy with too much hair gel, the next it's like he's been to three full mo𝚘𝗇s in a row. Did I menti𝗈𝗇 the crescendo 𝚖𝚞𝚜𝗂𝚌 that just screamed at you like a mistimed morning alarm? My back’s g𝗈𝗇na remember that seat too, fossilized like I’m the 𝚘𝗇e who turned out to be ancient.

And sniff, can you smell it, the 𝚌𝚒𝚗𝚎𝗆𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚌 musk? Or maybe it's just the leftover bite of nachos down my shirt... anything but ordinary, I tell ya, and while dazing through the fog, the plot just laid into my brain like an uncomfortable dream. Uh, there was a forest? Or was it a pub with a fake neon tree growing out of someone's shoulder? Did I even understand what 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Wolf Man meant? Does it even matter 𝗇𝚘𝗐?

The cli𝚖𝚊𝗑 – imagine a blender with its lid off, with emoti𝚘𝚗al guts flying everywhere. Wasn't it kinda like how ducks would fight if they 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁𝖾𝖽 too many kung fu 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝗂𝖾s?

Just thinking maybe I should 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝚊𝚍 Wolf Man again... or just sleep.
